cdn links are used to import react into our code 
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

if u go to into inspect and then console and  type react u can see all the react elements.
Why 2 links? first link contains reactcore concepts
2nd link is for react dom(30:29 sec)
